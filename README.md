# Snake_Game
Snake is an older classic video game. It was first created in late 70s. Later it was brought to PCs. In this game the player controls a snake. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible. Each time the snake eats an apple its body grows. The snake must avoid the walls and its own body. This game is sometimes called Nibbles.
The size of each of the joints of a snake is 10 px. The snake is controlled with the cursor keys. Initially, the snake has three joints. If the game is finished, the "Game Over" message is displayed in the middle of the board.
If the apple collides with the head, we increase the number of joints of the snake.
To understand it, look at how the snake is moving. We control the head of the snake. We can change its direction with the cursor keys. The rest of the joints move one position up the chain. The second joint moves where the first was, the third joint where the second was etc.
If the snake hits one of its joints with its head the game is over.
The game is finished if the snake hits the bottom of the board.
